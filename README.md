# The Cymraeg Challenge 
## About
The Cymraeg Challenge is an interactive game where users click on cards to reveal a Welsh or an English word. Users then have to try and match the word to its translation. When users match the cards correctly, the cards will disappear, and a point will be added to the score at the bottom of the page. When a user has incorrectly chosen a word pair, the card will ‘flip back over’, hiding the words on them and the game continues.  On finding all the word pairs, a notification congratulating the user on completing the game and asking if they want to play again will appear. 
In the header, there will be a ‘how to play’ link under the title. When clicked on, a notification telling users how to play the game will appear.
