# The Cymraeg Challenge 
## About
The Cymraeg Challenge is an interactive game where users click on cards to reveal a Welsh or an English word. Users then have to try and match the word to its translation. When users match the cards correctly, the cards will disappear, and a point will be added to the score at the bottom of the page. When a user has incorrectly chosen a word pair, the card will ‘flip back over’, hiding the words on them and the game continues.  On finding all the word pairs, a notification congratulating the user on completing the game and asking if they want to play again will appear. 
In the header, there will be a ‘how to play’ link under the title. When clicked on, a notification telling users how to play the game will appear.

## Design 
### Surface
#### Colour
The main colour scheme is an off-white colour (chosen to reduce eyestrain compared to pure white), a dark red, a mid toned red, a dark green and a mid-toned green.
The colour scheme was directly lifted from the colours of the Welsh flag, and then adjusted to improve contrast ratings. The colours do not impact on the ability to play the game, making it accessible for those who are red/green colour blind.

#### Typography
Karla was imported from google fonts for use in this project. Karla was chosen for its simple appearance and readability. As a sans-serif font, it avoids some of the issues associated with letters blending together for dyslexic readers.
